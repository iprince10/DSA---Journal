# Arrays Problems Journal

This section contains all the array problems I solve, along with short explanations of their approaches.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem 1:
**LeetCode 704** - Binary Search (https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search);
**Approach**
  - Use binary search
  - Time _O(log n ) | Space_O(1)

## ðŸ“Œ Problem 2:
**LeetCode 53** - Maximum Subarray ( https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray);
**Approach**
 - Use Kadane's Algorithm :Initialize current sum and max sum, track current sum, update maxsum with max(cs,ms) ,reset cs if negative, keep max.
 - Time_O(n) | Space_O(1)

## ðŸ“Œ Problem 3:
**LeetCode 121** - Best Time to buy and Sell Stock (https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock);
**Approach**
 - Intiliaze Buyprice with initial price or +infinity and maxprofit with 0 , update buyprice if selling price is lower (b.p.= s.p.) or calculate         profit if buyprice is < selling price.
 - Then update maxprofit with max(profit, maxprofit), keep maxprofit

## ðŸ“Œ Problem 4:
**LeetCode 42**-Trapping Rain Water(https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water);
**Approach**
 - Calculate leftmaximum and rightmaximum boundary by creating leftmax and rightmax array[]. [0]th index is same , other index are max(height[i],lm[i-1];
 - Calculate waterlevel for each height[i] by min(leftmax[i],rightmax[i]).
 - Initialize trappedrainwater by 0 and calculate trw by +=waterlevel -height[i].
 - keep trappedrainwater.
   
## ðŸ“Œ Problem 5:
**LeetCode 287**- Find the duplicate number (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number);
**Approach**
 - Use binary search on the value range from 1 to n.
 - For each mid, count how many numbers in the array are <= mid.
 - If count > mid, the duplicate must be in the left half; otherwise, itâ€™s in the right half.
 - Narrow down until low == high, which is the duplicate number.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem 6:
**LeetCode 136**- Single Number(https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number);
**Approach**
 - Bit Manipulation, initialize a variable index with 0 and for the array length:
 - XOR of number with itself is 0 and XOR of number with 0 is number itself, return index
